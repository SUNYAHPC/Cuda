##What is GPGPU
General Purpose computation using GPU in applications other than 3D graphics
 -GPU accelerates critical path of application 
Data parallel algorithms leverage GPU attributes
- Large data arrays, streaming throughput
- Fine-grain SIMD parallelism 
- Low-latency floating point (FP) computation 

Applications â€“ see //GPGPU.org 
- Game effects (FX) physics, image processing 
- Physical modeling, computational engineering, matrix algebra,convolution, correlation, sorting.
